## About
This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the NEAR blockchain, also referred to as NEAR DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the DIDs specification currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

Based on NEAR public chain, combined with distributed storage technology IPFS and Filecoin, data hot and cold storage;
Develop smart contracts using Rust language on NEAR, where users can select miners for data trading;
You can pay for your own storage by paying NEAR instead of paying Fil for data storage;
You can pay a small single fee to store their hot data on the IPFS network; In terms of cold data storage, Pay NEAR stores data on the Filecoin network based on storage miner quote, file size, storage cycle, etc.

## Data policy
You control your data! SDCloud doesn't keep your personal data; You can delete personal data from your account at any time. SDCloud has no advertising and does not sell your data; Your data is securely stored on the NEAR &IPFS&FILECOIN network;

## Ecological value
​ NEAR is a decentralized application platform built to bridge the users of today’s Internet to the blockchain-based web of the future. NEAR is a PoS Layer 1 blockchain platform, built with UX and DevX in mind. NEAR’s novel sharding mechanism, Nightshade, parallelizes computation on chain and automatically increases capacity when needed, resulting in theoretically infinite scalability.

​ Filecoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer storage network, allowing anyone to store and validate large-scale data as part of a global, 8-exabyte (and growing) network. Under the hood, all Filecoin nodes use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a content-addressed protocol for storing and sharing data.

We are going to build high-impact storage projects in the NEAR ecosystem, and SDCloud can change that;
Let more developers and enthusiasts pay attention to and participate in NEAR Ecology, and together build the ecological prosperity of the community.
